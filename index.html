    <h3>Who's Really Working for You</h3>
    <p>
      Legislation and Policy Proposals <br>
      Medicare for All Act: <br>

      Sanders has been a leading proponent of the Medicare for All Act, which aims to establish a single-payer healthcare system. Under this system, the government would negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies, potentially lowering costs significantly. <br>
      Prescription Drug Price Relief Act: <br>

      This bill, introduced by Sanders, seeks to lower drug prices by allowing the importation of cheaper prescription drugs from countries like Canada. It also proposes using competitive licensing to break up monopolies on drug patents if prices are deemed excessive. <br>
      Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act: <br>

      Sanders has repeatedly introduced legislation to allow Americans to import prescription drugs from Canada and other countries where prices are lower. This would provide consumers access to more affordable medications. <br>
      The Prescription Drug Price Reduction Act: <br>

      This bipartisan effort, supported by Sanders, aims to cap out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries and penalize drug companies that increase prices faster than inflation.<br>
